Changes in Version 0.1.09

  o fixed toLatex() output for diffusion matrix

Changes in Version 0.1.08

  o added CPoint() for change point estimation
  o fixed qmle() to handle models with parameters only 
	in the drift or in the diffusion coefficient


Changes in Version 0.1.05

  o added lasso() for adaptive lasso estimation
  
  o fixed hessina calculation for qmle()
  
Changes in Version 0.0.98

  o added lse() for least squares estimation of the drift parameters
  o fixed in qmle()/lse(): upper/lower arguments transformed into 'interval'
	automatically for one-dimesional optimization in both drift and diffusion
  
Changes in Version 0.0.97

  o no longer using adapt, we now use cubature which is GPL
	and available on CRAN. Package cubature and adapt use
	the same algorithm, with cubature being more general and
	up to date
	
  o adaBayes and asymptotic_term use not cubature

Changes in Version 0.0.94

  o implemented two stage estimation in qmle

  o optimized qmle for speed

  o changed interface to qmle: lower and upper must
    be a named list now

Changes in Version 0.0.91

  o added toLatex method for yuima objects.

  o when simulate is executed, the xinit slot in
    the return yuima object is set to the proper value.

Changes in Version 1.0.90

  o released first demo for R/Rmetrics conference, Meielisalp, 2010
